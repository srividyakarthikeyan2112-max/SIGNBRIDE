SignBridge — Turning Silence into Conversations

A two-way sign-language ↔ speech/text live translator focused on accessibility, inclusivity, and real-time communication. SignBridge uses AI, computer vision, and 3D avatars to enable seamless conversations between hearing and non-hearing communities.

✨ Features

Bidirectional translation: Sign → Text/Speech and Text/Speech → Sign (via 3D avatar).
Real-time processing: Low latency with gesture recognition and speech integration.
Cross-platform apps: Web (React.js) and Mobile (Flutter).
Accessibility built-in: High contrast, font scaling, keyboard navigation, theme toggle.
Data sync: Real-time chat history and preferences stored in Firebase.

🧱 Tech Stack
Frontend
React.js → For the responsive, web‑based interface.
Flutter → For cross‑platform mobile apps (Android + iOS).
Tailwind CSS → Styling for web frontend.
3D Avatars → Animated signing for natural communication.

Backend
Python ,Node.js + Express → API server, handles requests from frontend and manages communication with AI models.
REST APIs & WebSockets → Real‑time streaming and translation updates.

AI & Computer Vision
MediaPipe → Real‑time hand and gesture tracking.
TensorFlow Lite → Runs deep learning models efficiently on mobile and low‑end devices.
Transfer Learning with MobileNet → Improves accuracy for Indian Sign Language with smaller datasets.
Speech‑to‑Text & Text‑to‑Speech models → Enables full two‑way communication.

Database :Firebase Firestore → Real‑time NoSQL database for user data, preferences, and chat history. Lightweight, fast, and scalable.


📊 Feasibility & Impact
Technical: Works with proven tools — Mediapipe, TensorFlow Lite, 3D avatars.
Social: Addresses 63M+ deaf and hard‑of‑hearing people in India.
Business: Freemium for individuals, premium enterprise adoption.
Challenges: Dataset scarcity, performance tuning, privacy — solved via NGO partnerships, optimized models, and on‑device secure processing.
